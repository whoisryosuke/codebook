# Authentication

Auth is accomplished with the OAuth2.0 flow using various methods:

- Email/Password
- Phone number (Auth using SMS text)
- Anonymous (allows users to sign in temporarily, then become users)

## Permissions

You can control the read/write permissions using the database "Rules".

Permissions are written in a JSON format.

# Creating the Database

## Database Structure

Firebase uses a NoSQL based database (like MongoDB). This means that data will be structured as JSON.

# Querying (Read/Write)
