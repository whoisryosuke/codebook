# ‚öôÔ∏è Building / Deploying

## Enable Hermes for Performance Gains

Needs expanding. But speeds up app performance immensely, but requires heavy testing.

## Safe Area Inset

Wrap the contents of the App component with SafeAreaView from the [react-native-safe-area-view](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-native-safe-area-view) library. It is going to have a style prop with a flex of value 1 and another prop called forceInset. It‚Äôs important we add this, especially for some Android devices which might not behave as expected.

```jsx
// ... other import statements
import SafeAreaView from "react-native-safe-area-view";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }} forceInset={{ top: "always" }}>
        <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center" }}>
          <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
        </View>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```

This is what happens when you don't pass the `forceInset` on Android devices:

And with the forceInset prop applied:

Not sure if this applies to [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) ‚Äî which is used by Expo out of the box.
