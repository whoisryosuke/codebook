# Getting Started

React Native doesn't natively support SVG because SVGs are an HTML and DOM implementation. Using the library [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg) allows you to use SVGs inside in React Native (while obeying JSX and it's attribute rules - like camelCase naming).

## With Expo CLI

```jsx
expo install react-native-svg
```

## With NPM/Yarn

```jsx
yarn add react-native-svg
cd ios && pod install
```

# Examples

## Convert SVG to React SVG Component
